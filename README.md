Installation instructions: To install necessary gems

Install ITerm2 by going to https://www.iterm2.com/ then click "Download" at the bottom, and follow the instructions (moving it into your Applications folder when installation is completed).

Ruby is needed. To install Ruby: a) First check if Ruby is installed by entering "ruby -v" in your terminal (ITerm2). If it is installed, you will see a version such as "ruby 2.6.1p33". b) For installation instructions, if needed, see https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/

Clone the project onto your device, then after cloning, run "bundle install".

Next you'll need to open the backend,

After you have cloned and opened the file, open the backend and the frontend, then open seperate terminals one in the backend file and one in the frontend file. In the backend folder you'll need to run a few commands:

1) rails db:migrate 2) rails db:seed 
Once you've run these commands start your backend server by running rails s 

In the frontend file run the command npm start to open up a tab in your browser and display the webpage!
